Test with other syntax errors (like not having a ; or a : at the end of a property or a = after an attribute name or a missing ] or } or {).
Add qunit tests for new features with blanket.js coverage.
Add a "this" keyword that could be use in the second selector.
Support basic operations (width: +=10px; text: += "text";).

Support for conditions via inner block. For instance:
.button $click {
    .red {
        classes: +blue -red;
        color: blue;
    }
    .blue {
        classes: +red -blue;
        color: red;
    }
}

Add a way to prevent the default behavior (to stop navigating with a click on a link, for instance).
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.

Add support for properties (like checked; is it really needed?).
