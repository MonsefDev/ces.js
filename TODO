Put the code into a namespace (with a global object to have the ability to use it in the converter and the tests).
Add qunit tests with blanket.js coverage.
Use the rel="eventsheet" attribute to figure out if it is an event sheet instead of using endsWith('.ces').
Add a "this" keyword that could be use in the second selector.
Support basic operations (width: +=10px; text: += "text";).

Support for conditions via inner block. For instance:
.button $click {
    .red {
        classes: +blue -red;
        color: blue;
    }
    .blue {
        classes: +red -blue;
        color: red;
    }
}

Add a way to prevent the default behavior (to stop navigating with a click on a link, for instance).
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.

Add support for properties (like checked; is it really needed?).
