Add a way to change HTML attributes (with a syntax like [disabled="disabled"];).
Add a "this" keyword that could be use in the second selector.
Add tokens to add/remove/toggle (tokens +/-/~ ?) classes using the classList attribute (and other things, for instance toggle visibility).
Support basic operations (width: +=10px; text: += "text";).
Support for conditions via inner block. For instance:
.button $click {
    .red {
        classes: +blue -red;
        color: blue;
    }
    .blue {
        classes: +red -blue;
        color: red;
    }
}
Add a way to prevent the default behavior (to stop navigating with a click on a link, for instance).
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.

Add support for properties (like checked; is it really needed?).
