Add a way to change HTML attributes (with a syntax like [disabled="disabled"];).
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.
Add a "this" keyword that could be use in the second selector (and in the properties?).
Add tokens to add/remove/toggle (tokens +/-/~ ?) classes using the classList attribute (and other things, for instance toggle visibility).
Support basic operations (width: +=10px; text: += "text";).
Add a way to prevent the default behavior (to stop navigating with a click on a link, for instance).

Add support for properties (like checked; is it really needed?).
