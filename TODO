Test the code without white spaces in .ces files.
Add tests for comments (to be sure commented lines are not interpreted).
Add qunit tests for new features with blanket.js coverage.
Add a "this" keyword that could be use in the second selector.
Support basic operations (width: +=10px; text: += "text";).

Support for conditions via inner block. For instance:
.button $click {
    .red {
        classes: +blue -red;
        color: blue;
    }
    .blue {
        classes: +red -blue;
        color: red;
    }
}

Add a way to prevent the default behavior (to stop navigating with a click on a link, for instance).
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.

Add support for properties (like checked; is it really needed?).
