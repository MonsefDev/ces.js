Allow to create custom selector method (like :parent) with parameters.

Write some CES script and add needed features. For instance:
Create jQuery UI widgets with CES (accordion, autocomplete, button, datepicker, dialog, menu, progressbar, slider, spinner, tabs, tooltip).

Use JSHint to check the JavaScript source code.
Tests with other web browser.

Support an {{ index }} token for the methods text and html to allow different insertion at each iteration.
Add a start index property to decide at which index to start.

These probably won't be needed as they will be implemented by web browsers:
Add support for CSS variables (changing value)
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.

Support RequireJS.
