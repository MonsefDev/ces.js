Test with multiple increments and decrements to see if all of them are taken into account.
Test with css classes starting with -, + or ! if these are valid.

Support RequireJS.

Support for conditions via inner block. For instance:
.button $click {
    .red {
        classes: +blue -red;
        color: blue;
    }
    .blue {
        classes: +red -blue;
        color: red;
    }
}

Tests with other web browser.
Create jQuery UI widgets with CES and add needed feature (accordion, autocomplete, dialog, menu, progressbar, slider, spinner, tabs, tooltip).

These probably won't be needed as they will be implemented by web browsers:
Add support for CSS variables (changing value)
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.
Look to support other new features from CSS 3 and CSS 4.
