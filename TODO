Allow the "this" token at the start of a condition (for selection of multiple elements).

Write some CES script. For instance:
Create jQuery UI widgets with CES and add needed feature (accordion, autocomplete, button, datepicker, dialog, menu, progressbar, slider, spinner, tabs, tooltip).

Use JSHint to check the JavaScript source code.
Tests with other web browser.

Support an {{ index }} token for the methods text and html to allow different insertion at each iteration.
Add a start index property to decide at which index to start.

These probably won't be needed as they will be implemented by web browsers:
Add support for CSS variables (changing value)
Add the subject selector (perhaps ! from CSS4) to allow changing properties of parent elements.

Support RequireJS.
